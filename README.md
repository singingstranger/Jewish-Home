Three.js project using A-Frame for a simple image-based AR-app. 

The 3D models are superimposed upon 2D drawings, telling a story of a family in a quiet, private domestic setting. The drawings are based on photographs of real furniture pieces that belonged to their household.
I had to imagine what their lives around these pieces may have looked like. The real family, whom the furniture belonged to was later separated and killed during the Nazi era in Germany. 
The project was written in 2019 for a one-off art exhibition in university. 
Currently the project is non-functional due to the original host going down. Will revive the project shortly.
